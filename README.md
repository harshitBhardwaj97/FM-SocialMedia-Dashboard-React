# FM-Social-Media-Dashboard

This project was created using the following tech stack :-

    1. React JS (Vite)
    2. Tailwind CSS

Feel free to go through the code to see how components were re-used, including the socialmedia handles and the overview handles. Also instead of fully hardcoding the data, a data.js file was used, where the data can be manipulated that is being passed as props to the components, thus changing the content on UI.


## Lessons Learned

This was another good project, which enabled me to think in terms of components and reusability of those components. 

I used conditional rendering to change the text-color of delta count based on whehter there was increment or decrement. Got a good confidence in using the map to iterate over all the objects stored in local .js file, the same concept can be used to iterate over the data fetched from any API. 

All this might sound very basic but trust me having a good command over the basics helps greatly in the long run.

Also for the first time I deployed a React Application on Netifly, so that was also a good learning where CI/CD is automatically integrated and the changes are reflected in the application as they are pushed.
